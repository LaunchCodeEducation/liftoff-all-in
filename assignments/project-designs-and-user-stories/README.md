For this assignment, you'll create some initial plans for your project.

## Getting Started

Flesh out your project plan by creating:

1. At least 3 wireframes for initial pages that you will work on for your project. These can be hand-drawn wireframes that you have photographed using your smartphone, or image editor. Regardless of how you create them, your wireframes should be clear and readable.
1. As part of [your other assignment](../../assignments/project-github-repository-setup/), you created a GitHub account, and have since then created a repository for your project. Make sure you have added user stories for work that you plan on completing over the next week sprint to your GitHub project. You may add additional user stories if you like. Your stories should be clear, and formatted as proper user stories and not just todos. The should also have estimates.

## Submitting Your Work

Once you have finished both wireframe and user story components, submit your assignment on Canvas. Your mentor will provide feedback after the assignment deadline.
