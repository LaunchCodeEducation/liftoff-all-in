For this assignment, you are required to create a final draft of your resume and submit it in Canvas. A LaunchCode coach will then look over your resume and provide feedback. If we feel it's necessary, we will invite you to a personal coaching session to provide additional advice.

## Creating a Final Resume Guidelines

Use your rough draft as a starting point. Remember to create the 5 sections as outlined in the workshop.
1. Header
2. Technical Skills
3. Projects
4. Education
5. Work Experience

Formatting Guidelines: Stick with no less than 11pt font for the body, no more than 14pt for section headers, no less than .5" top/bottom margins, no less than .65" left/right margins, avoid using columns - keep it linear and reading left to right.

Submit your resume in Word or Google Docs format so we can make suggestions easily within the document.

## Verify your Social Presence

Triple check that all links and accounts are in working order. Make sure your LinkedIn matches your resume (we will be doing a deeper dive into LinkedIn in another workshop as well). Clean up your GitHub and start working on those README files for your projects.
