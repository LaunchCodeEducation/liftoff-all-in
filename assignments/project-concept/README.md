Create a high-level concept of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Expectations

* Your project will show off your abilities and demonstrate complex, marketable skills.
* Your project needs to be achievable in a reasonable timeframe. The sooner the better!
* You will maintain consistent commitment to meeting your project goals.
* You will be checking in weekly either via email or in person as determined by your project coordinator.
* You will use GitHub and Heroku for project management, version control, and deployment unless otherwise pre-determined by your project coordinator (such as you have your own domain you’d like to use to deploy).

## Considerations
* Time commitment. You know you can spend only so many hours a week on your project. Take that into consideration.
* What are your current skills and how can you expand on those with this project?
* What skills do you need to learn and demonstrate for your target job and how can you work those into your project?

## Creating Your Outline

Flesh out your concept by providing the following information:

1. **Overview**: In 1-2 paragraphs provide an "elevator pitch" for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

2. **Features**: List 5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name, and 1-2 sentence description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:  
    - **User login**: Users will be able to create accounts, and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
    - **Search**: Users will be able to search for blog posts containing given text.
    - **Create Post**: Users will be able to create new blog posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user's profile.

3. **Technologies**: What languages and technologies will you use to build your application? For example, for a Blog application, the technologies could be:
    - Python
    - JavaScript
    - MySQL

4. **What you'll have to learn**: In the course of building your project, you'll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front end more interactive. If you can't name the exact technology or technique that you'll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don't currently know how to solve.

## Submitting Your Concept

Once you’ve completed your project proposal, email it to Ben Shutt, ben@launchcode.org, before your meeting with him next week.
