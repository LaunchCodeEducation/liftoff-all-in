For this assignment, you will create a high-level concept of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Creating Your Outline

In the Liftoff: All-In Canvas course, open the assignment <b>Create Your Project Concept</b>. Flesh out your concept by providing the following information:

1. **Overview**: In 1-2 paragraphs provide an "elevator pitch" for your project. This should be a high-level overview of your idea, in non-technical language. What will your app do? What might users find useful about it? Where did the idea come from?

2. **Features**: List 5 features that you will implement in your project. Each feature should have a name, and 1-2 sentence description. Here are a few examples for a blog application:  
    - **User login**: Users will be able to create accounts, and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
    - **Search**: Users will be able to search for blog posts containing given text.
    - **Create Post**: Users will be able to create new blog posts when logged in. New posts will appear in the user's profile.

3. **Technologies**: What languages and technologies will you use to build your application? For example, for a Blog application, the technologies could be:
    - Python
    - JavaScript
    - MySQL

4. **What you'll have to learn**: In the course of building your project, you'll have to learn something new. Perhaps you want to use data from a public API, or add a bit of JavaScript to make your front end more interactive. If you can't name the exact technology or technique that you'll have to learn, you should still be able to describe a problem that you have identified that you don't currently know how to solve.

## Submitting Your Concept

Once you have finished your project concept, submit the assignment in Canvas by uploading your concept file. Your mentor and team will provide feedback after the assignment deadline. Practice your outline pitch before next week.
