2. **Brief description of topic**: In 2-3 sentences write out a brief description of the Meetup topic you completed about the topic at hand.

3. **Questions for Meetup**: List out any questions you may have after doing your research.

4. **Next steps for continuing to learn about the topic**: After attending the Meetup sum up what you learned in 2-3 sentences, and mention where you can go to learn more about the topic.

## Submitting your Write-up
After you have attended your meetup and completed your write-up, submit your document in the canvas assignment in the file format of your choosing.
