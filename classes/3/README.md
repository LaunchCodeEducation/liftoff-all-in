## Career Module: Online Profiles

Today's career module in class activity will consist of a discussion around Online Profiles: Resume, Github, and LinkedIn.

In our small groups we will create a README.md file for our project. If you have never added a README.md file to a Github please follow [this guide](../../articles/github-readme/).

You will then use the remaining class time to work on your project, or review any of the coursework so far.

## Project Module: First Deployment

We will be going over getting the code you committed deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/).

Once you have created your account and created an app, you can link your GitHub repository with this app and enable automatic deployment for one of your branches. This will trigger a new deployment whenever you make a commitment to that branch.
