## Career Module: Online Profiles

Today's career module is centered around Test Driven Development. After the speaker presentation, Ben will lead us in a hands on tutorial on TDD to give you a change to try it out for yourself.

Test Driven Development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. First the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
The following sequence of steps is generally followed:

1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and see if the new one fails
3. Write some code
4. Run tests
5. Refactor code
6. Repeat

## Project Module: First Deployment

We will be going over getting the code you committed deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com/).

Once you have created your account and created an app, you can link your GitHub repository with this app and enable automatic deployment for one of your branches. This will trigger a new deployment whenever you make a commitment to that branch.
