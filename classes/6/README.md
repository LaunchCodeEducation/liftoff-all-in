#### Using Meetup.com

As an assignment in class today we are going to sign up for Meetup.com, and RSVP for a meetup.

If you do not already have a Meetup.com account you can create one on their [website](https://secure.meetup.com/register/).

After creating your account:
1. Search for technical meetups
2. Select a meetup that matches a skill you have, or are trying to learn
3. Find the next event in the Meetup series
4. RSVP for the event
5. Mark your personal calendar

Meetups are a great place to learn new concepts, and to meet new programming professionals. Often times the people you meet at meetups will help you identify great resources for learning more about any given topic!
