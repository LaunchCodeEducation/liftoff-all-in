## Career Module

### Goal Role Clarity: Exploring Different Technical Jobs
When you first get into tech, the number of career options can be overwhelming. You might also struggle with narrowing down your interests or worry that you will miss out on opportunities if your +-focus is too narrow. However, having a clear vision and plan to reach your career goals actually aids you in your job search despite limiting the number of jobs to which you apply. In the tech world, it is imperative that we remain flexible with our languages and willing to learn anything while still deepening our knowledge and growing as developers. What does this mean? It means that we need to strike a balance between learning new skills and technologies and becoming experts in the tech we know.

As we go through the process of seeking jobs, having a broad range of things we would "be happy doing" can get us into trouble.

### Continued Education

#### Gathering Resources
Moving forward you are responsible for your own learning journey. This has pros and cons. No one is going to tell you what to learn, or provide you with any resources on how to learn. However, you get to choose what you want to learn, and can get to choose your own resources!

If you haven't already it's time to begin creating a list of topics, programming langauges, and technologies you want to learn, and resources to learn them from.

We discussed multiple ways of continuing to learn as a developer including:
- Using Online Resources
- Reading Books
- Building Projects
- Attending Conferences
- Attending Meetups


## Project Module

### What makes a good project?
1. Demonstrate marketable skills.
2. Demonstrate your ability to learn new things.
3. Solves a problem.

### Group Project Outline
Everyone participating in Liftoff: All-In&lt;tech> is participating in a group project. Although ultimately your group will only produce one project, we want everyone to pitch a project and create an outline to present to their group and Teaching Fellow. You will then vote as a group on the project you want to develop during the program.

Reference our [project outline assignment](..assignments/project-outline/) for planning your project.

### Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools<br>
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation<br>
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation<br>
**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
