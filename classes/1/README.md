## Career Module: Goal Role Clarity

### Goal Role Clarity: Exploring Different Technical Jobs
When you first get into tech, the number of career options can be overwhelming. You might also struggle with narrowing down your interests or worry that you will miss out on opportunities if your +-focus is too narrow. However, having a clear vision and plan to reach your career goals actually aids you in your job search despite limiting the number of jobs to which you apply. In the tech world, it is imperative that we remain flexible with our languages and willing to learn anything while still deepening our knowledge and growing as developers. What does this mean? It means that we need to strike a balance between learning new skills and technologies and becoming experts in the tech we know.

As we go through the process of seeking jobs, having a broad range of things we would "be happy doing" can get us into trouble.

### Continued Education

#### Gathering Resources
Moving forward you are responsible for your own learning journey. This has pros and cons. No one is going to tell you what to learn, or provide you with any resources on how to learn. However, you get to choose what you want to learn, and can get to choose your own resources!

If you haven't already it's time to begin creating a list of topics, programming languages, and technologies you want to learn, and resources to learn them from.

We discussed multiple ways of continuing to learn as a developer including:
- Using Online Resources
- Reading Books
- Building Projects
- Attending Conferences
- Attending Meetups

## Project Module: Components of a Successful Group Project

### Meet Your Group

#### Get to know your teammates
- Introduce yourself
- What do they specialize in?
- What part of programming do they like the most?
- How much time do they **know** they can commit to the project?

### Group Discussion

#### What makes a project good for your portfolio?
- Demonstrate marketable skills.
- Demonstrate your ability to learn new things.
- Solves a problem.

#### How do you develop your project well?
- What should you do?
- What should you avoid?

### The Many Faces of Development

#### User Stories

Your first batch of user stories can be challenging. This is not uncommon and all it takes is practice and perseverance.

Follow these simple steps to writing a user stories and you'll be writing them like a pro in no time:

##### As a [role], I can [feature] so that [reason]

Following this simple pattern makes writing user stories easy and manageable.

For Example:

As a account owner, I can check my balance online so that I can keep a daily balance 24 hours a day. |

You have some options on how you'd like to format. If the above framework doesn't work for you, you can cut some of the extra words. Feel free to use one of these variations:

*As a [role], I want [feature] because [reason]
As a [role], I can [feature]
As a [role], I can [feature] so that [reason]*

##### Use index cards and a Sharpie

When creating new user stories, always hand write your new stories on a single side of a index card using a Sharpie marker. I realize that a majority of shops use issue trackers like Jira; however, doing this physical activity will aid you in creating the correct size of user story.<br><br>
_Index Cards_<br>
The theory is simple – if you use any larger than a 3″ x 5″ index card you will write too much. Likewise, if you use anything smaller than a marker (aka ball point pen) – you will write too much.

User stories are suppose to be short and sweet. They are suppose to aid in further communication and not to tell the entire long-winded version of the story. Sticking to these physical constraints will help.

##### Make it testable with acceptance stories

Write out any of your acceptance tests using this template:

*Scenario 1: Title<br>
Given [context]<br>
And [some more context]…<br>
When [event]<br>
Then [outcome]<br>
And [another outcome]…<br>*

For example:

*Scenario 1: Account balance is negative
Given the account’s balance is below 0
And their is not a scheduled direct deposit that day
When the account owner attempts to withdraw money
Then the bank will deny it
And send the account owner a nasty letter.*

Again, keep user stories small to only allow enough scope so that all of my acceptance stories can be written using a ball point pen on the backside of the user story index card.

If your user story has more than 3-4 acceptance stories, really analyze the story and see if it makes sense to break it down even further so you can fit all its acceptance tests on the back of the card. Doing so might help you break down those larger stories into more digestible pieces.

##### Connect the dots

Write out all the possible user stories you can currently think of. I guarantee that you will be missing some of the project scope; however with a little luck, you will be able to connect the dots and see the entire project picture.

#### Wireframes
The skeletal framework of the user experience

#### Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

#### GitHub
Backing up your work

### Planning

#### Why we plan our projects
- Know what we need to get done
- Know when we need to get it done by
- Know how it can all go wrong
- Know how to get it done despite

#### Making a timeline
- When to stop adding features, and preventing feature creep
- When to finish those features, and making a complete product
- When it needs to be stable, and leaving enough time
- Giving yourself room to breath when the unexpected happens

#### Team communication
- Having the same expectations
- By what means do you communication
  - In person?
  - Online?
- Making sure you stay on the same page
  - Letting people know when you run into trouble
  - Staying in touch as you work
  - Scheduling meetings

#### Tracking progress and information
- Keeping track of bugs
- Keeping track of tasks and deadlines
- Documenting features and notes

#### Committing to the project
- Compare and contrast good vs bad team behavior
- Commit to your project as future professionals
