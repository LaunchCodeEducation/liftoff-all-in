## Career Module: Business Etiquette

Why business etiquette?

Business etiquette provides a standard framework within which business people can operate as they communicate and collaborate. Attention to etiquette is a sign of professionalism and respect for others, and it can make positive first impressions while building trust among colleagues.

We encourage you to bring your questions and are committed to provide a safe space to have all your business etiquette questions answered.
