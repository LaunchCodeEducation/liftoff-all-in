## Career Module: Resume and Portfolio Development

There are 2 components to think about when developing your resume and portfolio.

<<<<<<< HEAD
**The Resume**<br>
  <p class ="tab">Creating a technical resume for your first programming job works a little differently than typical resumes. Typically we include 5 sections: a header, technical skills, projects, education, and work experience. The order of these sections depends a little bit on your work experience and education but the key rule of thumb is that technical skills should _always_ be at the top. You want employers to immediately see your skills so they are enticed to read more!</p>


**Your Online Presence**<br>
    <p class = "tab">*Code Repositories* - employers want to see your code and projects. GitHub is a great way to show them your work and an easy way to reference the code for the projects you showcase on your resume by including a direct link.</p>
    <p class = "tab">*LinkedIn* - Be sure to keep your LinkedIn account current with your resume. Unexplained inconsistencies can set off red flags to employers. We will go more in depth on how to setup a professional LinkedIn profile in a future workshop.</p>
    <p class = "tab">*Personal Website* - If you are a web developer, it's essential to have a personal website to showcase your skills and as a marketing aid. Start simple and add to it as you have time. The key is to make this professional. The best personal websites are set up as if they are freelancers and this is their business site. They may be trying to attract clients but employers will respond the same if they like what they see.</p>
