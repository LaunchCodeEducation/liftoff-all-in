### UX

UX is short for "user experience", and is the design discipline focused on making products that place primary importance on a user's experiences and interactions. A critical part of the UX design process is wireframing, which is a technique to sketch out web pages and views in a rough way that focuses on how elements are arranged, and how users are likely to interact with them.

This isn't a design class, and most developers work with designers to create the best products possible. While you won't be expected to be an expert at UX and design, it is important to have an appreciation for the elements of design, and to have a user focus when working on your project.

### Project Organization

You may have heard the term "agile" before, but likely don't have a good idea of what it means in reference to software development. We'll dig into agile in a later module, but for now you should now that it is a general category of softare development and team organization practices.

We are going to use some of the most basic agile planning and communications practices throughout this course. In agile development,  **ceremonies** are formal planning and communication activities that are organized around a **sprint**. Sprints are simply time-bound windows of work. For example, teams may choose to have 1-week, 2-week, or 4-week sprints, and each sprint includes the ceremonies described in the article below.

We will use the concept of a sprint, along with the associated ceremonies, within the Liftoff course.

Most agile articles (including the one below) are littered with jargon that can be difficult to wrap your head around at first. Don't focus much on all of the terminology, but instead on the 4 basic cermonies and the role they play in project planning and execution.
