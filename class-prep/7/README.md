## Career Module: Online Profiles

This week's career module focuses on the profiles companies will view before and during the interview process. We will manipulate these profiles in a way that will assist you during your job search. For prep-work we will examine the following: a resume, a GitHub profile, and a LinkedIn profile. We will go over what makes the profile good and highlight where the profile can be improved. This will give us a list of things to include as well as things to leave out of each profile.
